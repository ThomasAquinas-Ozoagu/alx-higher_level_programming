This is my doctest file for 2-matrix_divided.py

>>> matrix_divided = __import__('2-matrix_divided').matrix_divided

a function that divides all elements of a matrix

>>> matrix = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]

>>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, 3))
[[0.33, 0.67, 1.0], [1.33, 1.67, 2.0]]

>>> print(matrix)
[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]

""" checks if divisor is a number """
>>> try:
...     print(matrix_divided(matrix, 'c'))
... except Exception as e:
...     print(e)
...
div must be a number

""" checks if each row has same size """
>>> matrix2 = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6, 8]]

>>> try:
...     print(matrix_divided(matrix2, 3))
... except Exception as e:
...     print(e)
...
Each row of the matrix must have the same size

>>> matrix3 = [[1, 3, 5], (4, 7, 9)]

>>> try:
...     print(matrix_divided(matrix3, 3))
... except Exception as e:
...     print(e)
...
matrix must be a matrix (list of lists) of integers/floats

>>> try:
...	print(matrix_divided(matrix, 0))
... except Exception as e:
... 	print(e)
...
division by zero

>>> matrix = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 'b']]

>>> try:
... 	print(matrix_divided(matrix, 0))
... except Exception as e:
... 	print(e)
...
matrix must be a matrix (list of lists) of integers/floats
